      h1 What is Dubsdot
      p.
        Dubsdot is a Web server running on one of COSI's VM Hosts (Bennu). It is
        running a Debian 8 install and all websites are ported through a Apache
        VirtualHost.
        
      h3 How can I put a site on Dubsdot?
      p.
        Either bring up a forum topic at our Wednesday meeting, or come see the
        Webmaster, Benjamin Lannon, in the labs. If the site / application would
        fit well on Dubsdot, he can help put it on the server fairly quickly.
        The one requirement is that an application on Dubsdot should benefit
        COSI in some way.
